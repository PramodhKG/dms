Openfire is an instant messaging server that implements the XMPP(jabber) protocol. It features high performance, a robust administration console, and a full plug-in system.
The server is 100% java
Openfire is a professional open source project, led by jive Software.

 
Openfire is 100% java so java installation on the ubuntu server is mandatory.
Unfortunately , Openfire does not work with the OpenJDK Java Runtime Environment. So Sun JRE should be installed
